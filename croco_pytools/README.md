These scripts were taken from crocotools v1.0.

The scripts were written in Python 2, with some modifications made. The files will remain in pyroms_MI until future 
notice for reference purposes. The folder Oforc_GLORYS_python 
(taken from the dev branch of crocotools on INRIA's gitlab) contains all necessary scripts for interpolation of 
initial conditions and boundary conditions from CMEMS IBI PHY and BGC.
